    "output": "An atom is made up of a nucleus, which contains protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons that travel in orbits around the nucleus. The protons and neutrons have a positive charge, while the electrons have a negative charge, resulting in an overall neutral atom. The number of each particle determines the atomic number and the type of atom."
